# Interception
Hello all, and thank you for your interest in Interception! This is your guide to playing the game:

OVERVIEW -

You play as a virus in the deep web, who must override 4 different terminals in order to infect the host computer. The host computer is, of course, guarded by anti-virus guards. You must navigate your way around using 3 different camouflaging colours: Red, Green and Blue. To camouflage, you must stand on a corresponding floor colour before using that colour key. For example, if you’re standing on a red floor, the red colour camouflages you. Using the red colour on a blue floor will not camouflage you!  Camouflaging drains your energy bar rather quickly. But, you also have a gun! Here’s the catch though, we designed it to be intended for use in last-minute situations only, as one shot drains your bar COMPLETELY. 



MANUAL -

As explained above, you must navigate 4 different terminals: 
![intro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476311-83cb0506-c344-11e7-9a6c-eaaa2d7dd42e.png)

Here’s the map of the host computer we want to infect:

The four terminals are located by a thin beaming light. We understand the map is huge, so we used the beaming light as a design choice should players get lost trying to find a terminal. 
![switch 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476153-95495b30-c343-11e7-912a-0b48c282c85f.png)

The four terminals spawn at four different locations out of eleven, at random. Each play through changes the locations of the terminals, with a total of 5544 possible mixes! 
![switch 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476154-955b5650-c343-11e7-8079-95ce4e056923.png)

This is the top part of your HUD. 
![nav bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476161-95f3c714-c343-11e7-954c-fd00dbd115e3.png)
On the left we have the 3 different numbered keys to change to a corresponding colour, depending on the floor you’re standing on.
On the right we have the energy bar. Green for full. Red for empty. If it’s empty (or some energy drained), it recharges after 3 seconds. 

This is you, the player.

Activate the four switches around the map in order to activate the final terminal to infect the host computer.

This is an enemy. 


When an enemy spots you, a red exclamation mark appears on the top of his head.

When you camouflage in the knick of time, a question mark appears on the top of his head, and he walks away.

If you don’t have energy to camouflage or shoot, that’s ok! We understand that this is pretty difficult for players to navigate around. This is why we included many boulders for the player to crawl around under cover. This ensures that he/she doesn’t get spotted, while also riling up on some energy as they patiently wait. 
![crawl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476160-95dc988c-c343-11e7-9d0e-2772bc6fa4b9.png)

This is the player aiming (after he shoots)
![aim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476163-9619c356-c343-11e7-830e-56d1bd6235cc.png)

This is the enemy being stunned. You have 2-3 seconds to get out of there before they become conscious again. 
![stun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374699/32476166-96596aba-c343-11e7-8779-ce8b2ea80541.png)

ONLY USE THE GUN WHEN YOU NEED TO! An example would be if an enemy spots you on an uncoloured floor, and you have no boulders around you to crawl away from the enemy. What you should do in that situation is run until your energy builds, turn around, and shoot the enemy. 

After activating the four terminals, the player can then access the final computer, shown here!

We hope you enjoy it!
